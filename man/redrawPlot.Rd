\title{Redraw a recordedplot, grid, trellis, or ggplot2 plot.}
\usage{
redrawPlot(rec_plot)
}
\arguments{
\item{rec_plot}{the plot object to redraw}
}
\description{
This function redraws the plot represented by \code{rec_plot}. It can redraw grid/trellis/ggplot2/etc plots, as well as \code{recordedplot} objects. For \code{recordedplot} objects it acts as a wrapper around \code{replayPlot} with memory tweaks to fix native symbol address errors when the recordedplot was loaded from an rda/rds file.
