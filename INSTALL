Installing Pandoc
=================

Converting functions of `pander` depends on John MacFarlane's universal document converter: Pandoc.

Of course the other features of `pander` can be used without installing Pandoc, but I would really suggest you to install that great software.

All major platforms are supported with a simple click-click-click installation binary (or compile from sources):

Development version of pander
=============================

As `pander` is under heavy development I would suggest to try out an up-to-date version, as I would not bother CRAN with frequent releases:

    https://github.com/rapporter/pander

Installation from GitHub is easy with `devtools` useful function:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('pander', 'rapporter')

To compile/install from sources on Windows, you would need to install Rtools:
